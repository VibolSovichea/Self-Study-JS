# Greeting Guys!

This is a github repository that I made to share my understanding of JavaScript. Some of the contents or lessons that I have listed here might have mistakes so feel free to let me know as I'm also learning.
This repository is also use as a place to store documents relating to our journey in learning JavaScript with my teammates during break;
I hope I can share my passion and journey in programming with my fellow friends and get better together in the future.
